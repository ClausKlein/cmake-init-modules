Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/clausklein/Workspace/cpp/cxx20/cmake-init-modules/cmake-init-modules/.git/

The project is ready to be used with git. If you are using GitHub, you may
push the project with the following commands from the project directory:

    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git flow init -d
    git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-account>/<repository>.git
    git push -u origin master

To get started with developing the project, make sure you read the generated
HACKING.md and BUILDING.md files for how to build the project as a developer or
as a user respectively. There are also some details you may want to fill in in
the README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md and .github/workflows/ci.yml files.

Now make sure you have at least CMake 3.20 installed for local development, to
make use of all the nice Quality-of-Life improvements in newer releases:
